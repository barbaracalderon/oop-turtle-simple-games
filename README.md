# Object-Oriented-Programming | Simple Python Games with the Turtle Module
 
 These are a series of simple games created in the Python language. Everything was done using the Turtle Module and the concepts of Object-Oriented-Programming (OOP). I'm learning more on this matter. These files were created for Dr. Angela Yu's Python Bootcamp challenges from the London App Brewery.
 
 Each directory is a simple game.

 I hope this repository is helpful in some way.
